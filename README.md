## Machine Learning Model for weather prediction and error predeiction using tensorflow.

This machine learning model has been trained to read the dataset (csv file) provided by the user and present the graph for the temperature , precipitation , humidity etc.
In the second section , it will also be trained to detect the errors  in the prediction of central tendencies. So let's see how the code actually works:-
